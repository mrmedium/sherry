### How i learnt to code
So i was exploring youtube when i discorvered [cs50](https://m.youtube.com/c/cs50) it is a course made by harvard that gives an introduction to computer science and programming. I also watched their cs50p series in which they teach python.

So the thing is computer science has alot of branches: Game Development, Web Development, Application Development, Cyber security..... so far i have been getting a taste of every one of these branches to find out the right one for me.
